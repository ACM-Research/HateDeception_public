# build night 3 

## objectives

- Start training imitation model using dataset
	- Load data into code
	- Pick an ideal train/test split
	- Preprocess data (transform it w/ text vectorization)
		- TF-IDF
	- Choose algorithm
		- Algorithms: Adaboost, Naive Bayes, SVM
	- Meet with faculty advisor this week


## homework

- Train imitation model
- During development, you will have many questions for the Faculty Advisor, so make sure to write them down for our next meeting.
	- Schedule next meeting with Faculty Advisor
		- When2Meet Link: (TBD)
