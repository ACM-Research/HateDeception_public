# build night 5 

## objectives

- Split the team- Defense and Attack
- Defense team
   - Continue training model
   - Test model and optimize by adjusting:
  	- Hyperparameters
  	- Classification Algorithms
  	- Feature processing/extraction techniques (polynomial regression)
  	- Cross validation (method of splitting train/test data)
   - Display results 
- Attack team
   - Try EDA (Electronic Design Automation)
   - Use text attack package
   - Try other attack methods


## homework

- Do additional research on methods to optimize model (will provide further materials)
- Ideally have imitation model trained and finished by next week so we can move onto attack model

Resources for homework:
- Dr. Khan and Dr. Yibo Hu's paper on using blackbox attack methods ie. EDA and text attack packages: https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.486/
- The other adversarial attack toolbox beside foolbox: https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox
- This one has useful AI cheatsheet: https://becominghuman.ai/cheat-sheets-for-ai-neural-networks-machine-learning-deep-learning-big-data-678c51b4b463
- This one is about generative adversarial network (GAN) on generating
